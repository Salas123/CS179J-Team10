# CS 179J - Team 10 Project

This is our Embedded Systems project.

## Tilting action camera:

The camera rests on a Pan Tilt Kit which is composed of 2 servo motors.  This lets the camera rotate 90 degrees in every direction (up, down, left, right). This Pan Tilt Kit is attached to our linear actuator which can control the height of the camera (picture). This linear actuator is then connected to our car chassis, which can also move forward, backward, left, and right. More importantly, our entire system can be controlled by using our mobile application.

## To run app:
Run ```npm install ```inside the project file 

Next, run ```expo start``` or ```npm start``` to run web app and open expo app to run it on your phone


If it doesn't run on your phone, try  ```expo start --no-dev --minify```
